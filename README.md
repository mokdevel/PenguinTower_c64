## Background
The game has been 'in development' since 199x and was never finished. While it would've been great to have the game ready, the interest kind of disappeared. Getting something ready up to 90% is easy and the last 10% takes a lot of time. Eventually the C64 was replaced with a PC, adulthood with family and responsibilities took, other hobbies entered my life. The game project was abandoned .. until now. 

Just by coincidence I got interested in looking at C64 development environments. C64 Studio looked interesting and did some quick tests. Oh man, it has everything one could dream of. Amazing piece of software and really lit my interest in C64 coding. Go get it from https://www.georg-rottensteiner.de/en/c64.html#C64_Studio . And the developer is frienldy and quickly reacting to any findings. See: https://github.com/GeorgRottensteiner/C64Studio

Luckily I had my code floppies tranferred to PC years back. It took some time to get everything to proper format but eventually first compilation was successful! Then it was just development work to get the final pieces done. Since the first successful compilation, a lot of bugs has been fixed, new features added, intro and endtro created, new gfx drawn. A small fix ended up in quite a lot of work. It was fun. And now the game is released. 

### Thanks 
- Big thanks to testers (Ulla, Alma, Antero, Akseli, Alina, Anni, Skape).
- Skape for support and de/packer code
- Georg Rottensteiner for the amazing C64 Studio. This project would not have been finalized without it.

### Fun facts
- A few previews were shared with 10 playable levels. Then the game crashed - this was on purpose.
- The exists a unfinished PC version written in assembler. Nope, that will never be finished.
