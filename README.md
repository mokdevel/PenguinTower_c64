## Background
The game has been 'in development' since 199x and was never finished. While it would've been great to have the game ready, the interest kind of disappeared. Getting something ready up to 90% is easy and the last 10% takes a lot of time. Eventually the C64 was replaced with a PC, adulthood with family and responsibilities took, other hobbies entered my life. The game project was abandoned .. until now. 


### Fun facts
- A few previews were shared with 10 playable levels. Then the game crashed - this was on purpose.
- The exists a unfinished PC version written in assembler. Nope, that will never be finished.
